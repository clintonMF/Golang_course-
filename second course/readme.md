# FUNCTIONS METHODS AND INTERFACES IN GO
The second course in the golang course series of ***University of California, Irvine***

## HOW TO USE THIS FOLDER
- The folder is all about the second course in the specialization
- the course is split into 4 weeks
- In each week we have various concepts which are arranged by numbers meaning we 
have numbers before the names of the concepts. This is to ensure that the concepts 
are looked at in the right order 
- there are other files in the week which do not have numbers before them, these files
are assignment files which include my assignment and those of others which i marked.
- My assignment always has the name of the program and never includes the word assignment
- My assignment also has the question asked
- Those of my peers always has the name assignment or an abbreviation attached.
